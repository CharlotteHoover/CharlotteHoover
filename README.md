Hi, I'm Char!
I'm a Visual Effects student at Savannah College of Art and Design.
I am currently learning Python and Linux for procedural 3D modeling and compositing.
I fell in love with coding during one of my introductory classes and I'm trying to immerse myself in this world as much as possible!
